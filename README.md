# Nadia's Personal Website

Assignment 8 - Implementing a Web Portfolio

Created the general website and layout. Blog posts not all updated (just put more topics to show intent, the only blog post up is "Everything happens for a reason"). Experience cards currently not linked - focused more on setting up the layout and on my personal story.
